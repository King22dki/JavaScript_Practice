/** A Narcissitic Number (Or Armstrong Number)
 * 
 * A positive number which is the sum of it's own digits,
 * rasied to the power of the number of digits in a given 
 * base. In the first example we will look at decimal (base 10).
 * 
 * For example, take 153(3 digits), which is narcissistic:
 * 
 * 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153 
 * 
 * Now let's look at a number that isn't narcissistic,
 * 1652 (4 digits):
 * 
 * 1^4 + 6^4 + 5^4 + 2^4 = 1 + 1296 + 625 + 16 = 1938
 * 
 * The Challenge:
 * 
 * Your code must return true or false (not 'true' and 'false')
 * depending upon whether the given number is a Narcissistic number
 * in base 10.
