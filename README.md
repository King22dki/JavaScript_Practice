Updated JavaScript Practice README

# JavaScript Practice

This repository serves as a means for me to practice JavaScript for use in web development. I'm starting from the basics and gradually working my way up to more advanced concepts.

## Contents

- `Basic_info.html` & `Basic_info.js`: Basic JavaScript information and examples
- `Game.html` & `Game.js`: Simple JavaScript game implementations
- `game2.html` & `game3.html`: Additional game variations and experiments
- `JavaScriptExample.js`: Various JavaScript code examples
- `string_function.js`: Practice with string manipulation in JavaScript
- `index.html` & `index.js`: Main entry point for the project

## Learning Resources

Currently, I'm working through [insert video title or link here]. This video is helping me build a strong foundation in JavaScript.

## Projects

### Random Games
Several HTML files (`Game.html`, `game2.html`, `game3.html`) contain different game implementations. These serve as practical exercises for applying JavaScript in interactive web applications.

### Pokémon-like Game
There's a work-in-progress Pokémon-like game. The current plan is to start with a test boundary before expanding the game further.

### Minecraft Clone
Another project in the works is a Minecraft-inspired clone. This will help in practicing more advanced JavaScript concepts and possibly 3D graphics in the browser.

## Future Plans

- Complete the Pokémon-like game, focusing first on core mechanics
- Develop the Minecraft clone further
- Explore machine learning concepts with JavaScript
- Continue adding more complex JavaScript examples and projects

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the different files and projects. To run any of the HTML files, simply open them in a web browser. For the JavaScript files, you can run them using Node.js or include them in an HTML file.

## Contributions

While this is a personal learning repository, suggestions and feedback are always welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have any improvements or ideas.

Happy coding!
